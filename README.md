# EasyTraffic

![Cannot Load Image](EasyTrafficAppIcon.png)

Welcome! EasyTraffic is an iOS app that I have been working on in Swift that is used to detect stop signs by propping your phone on your dashboard. 

Current features include separate user profiles and the creation of family groups. Detection is limited to stop signs for now, but I plan on expanding to red lights and rolling stop detection.

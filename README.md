# EasyTraffic

![Cannot Load Image](EasyTrafficIconSmall.png)

Welcome! EasyTraffic is an iOS app that I have been working on in Swift that is used to detect stop signs by propping your phone on your dashboard. 

Current features include separate user profiles and the creation of family groups, now stored in Firebase! Detection now includes stop signs and rolling stops, but I plan on expanding to red lights too.
